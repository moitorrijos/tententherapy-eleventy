        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to help patients engage with their emotional and traumatic experiences with the objective of decreasing trauma related symptoms and issues; utilize elements of PE Therapy for PTSD as part of psychoeducational treatment.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to conceptualize and implement an in-vivo exposure hierarchy of activities to promote patients learning by exposure to safe activities.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to help patients select a proper index trauma, oversee the imaginal exposure and hot spots protocol of traumatic memories.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to recognize and discuss avoidance, over and under engagement behaviors during PE Therapy sessions and imaginal exposure. </li>

      <p><strong>Workshop Goal:</strong> The overall goal for this workshop is to provide mental health professionals with an intensive Prolonged Exposure workshop to gain the skills and knowledge on how to utilize Prolonged Exposure Therapy to treat trauma survivors within their respective practices, organizations and community. The workshop will cover the fundamental components of Prolonged Exposure Therapy and how to adjust PE techniques to provide treatment based on the client’s reaction to exposure. The workshop will help social workers maintain focus on providing PTSD treatment concurrently/remaining flexible while following the therapy manual. The workshop presenter will utilize lectures, discussions, demonstration of videotape therapy sessions and role-playing with feedback to achieve the objectives for the workshop.</p>
      <p><strong>Who can attend:</strong>  Licensed mental health professionals (Social Workers, Psychologist, Professional Counselors, Marriage and Family Therapist) or those working under a licensed mental health professional.

      <ul>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to describe PTSD and its psychopathology, explain emotional processing theory in association to PE Therapy for PTSD and discuss how other evidence-based treatment modalities for PTSD compare in efficacy to PE Therapy.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to help patients engage with their emotional and traumatic experiences with the objective of decreasing trauma related symptoms and issues; utilize elements of PE Therapy for PTSD as part of psychoeducational treatment.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to conceptualize and implement an in-vivo exposure hierarchy of activities to promote patients learning by exposure to safe activities.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to help patients select a proper index trauma, oversee the imaginal exposure and hot spots protocol of traumatic memories.</li>
        <li>Workshop participants will learn how to recognize and discuss avoidance, over and under engagement behaviors during PE Therapy sessions and imaginal exposure. </li>
